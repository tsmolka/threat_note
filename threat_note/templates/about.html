This app was developed by <a href="http://www.defpoint.com">Defense Point Security</a> for individual security researchers to track their investigations and quickly retrieve information related to different objects (IP's, domains, threat actors, etc.). This app fills the gap of running a full-fledged indicator-storage solution requiring a great deal of setting up and configuring, as well as other web apps requiring signing up and having some limitations without paying for enterprise features.
              </p>
              This app uses Python, Flask, and sqlite to deliver a small, portable research app that doesn't require a lot of setup, which means you can quickly and easily deploy the app without worrying about maintaining and troubleshooting installation procedures.
              </p>
              By having a rapidly deployable webapp that can store your information related to incidents or malware research, you can quickly delete and start your research over, keeping things isolated per incident. You can also export any indicators you enter into a variety of formats (STIX, TAXII, OpenIOC, Bro intel, etc.) to share with colleagues or the security community at large.
